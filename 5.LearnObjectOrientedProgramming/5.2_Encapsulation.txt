Encapsulation is the method of hiding complexity so minimize uneccessary information.

A function is a method of Encapsulation. When you call the function, the only important details are the inputs and outputs.


Public and private properties:
By default, all properties and methods in a class are public. Being public means that they are accessible using the '.' operator.

Private data members are how we encapsulate logic and data within a class. To make a property private, you just need to prefix it with two underscores.
The purpose is to identify which properties and methods are required to be accessible outside of the class, and which properties are only required within the class for calculations.

____Python____

class Wizard:
    def __init__(self, name, stamina, intelligence):
        self.__stamina = stamina
        self.__intelligence = intelligence
        
        self.name = name
        self.mana  = 100 * self.__intelligence
        self.health = 100 * self.__stamina

______________

properties __stamina and __intelligence are not addressable outside the class.

This does not constitute security and should not be used for secure code. The practice is for organization.

the convention of using __foo is simply convention and not a forced rule like in other languages. __foo suggests that users of that class shouldn't modify these properties.
